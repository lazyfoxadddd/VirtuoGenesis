#### 3. Instructional Strategy  
###### Name of Instructional Strategy: <u>Simulation-Based Learning</u>  
###### Assessment Method: <u>Task-oriented visual interpretation & objective questions</u>  

<u><b>Description:</b></u>  
Students will interact with a virtual lab that computes and plots the Fourier and Z-transforms for a given signal. The simulator will show step-by-step signal transformation and visual results to enhance understanding of frequency and complex domain representations.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions

Sr. No | Learning Objective | Task to be performed by the student in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1. | Understand Fourier Transform | Input a discrete-time signal and view its Fourier magnitude spectrum. | What does the peak in the magnitude spectrum indicate?  
2. | Apply Z-transform | Input a discrete-time signal and visualize the Z-transform on the complex plane. | What does the unit circle represent in the Z-domain?  
3. | Analyze & Compare | Compare both transform plots to analyze frequency domain vs complex domain. | Which transform better visualizes phase shifts in signals?

#### 5. Simulator Interactions

Sr.No | What Students will do? | What Simulator will do? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1. | Input a list of signal values in a form | Compute DFT and generate Fourier magnitude plot | To help visualize frequency content of the signal  
2. | Input the same signal for Z-transform | Compute Z-transform and display plot in complex plane | To understand signal behavior in the Z-domain
